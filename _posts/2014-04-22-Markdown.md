## The Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is defined as follows:

$$latex
f(x;\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 }
$$

To generate random draws from a normal distribution we use the **rnorm** function:

```{r block1}
output <- rnorm(1000, 100, 15);
```

The normal distribution has the typical bell shape:

```{r block2, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ggplot2::qplot(output)
```
